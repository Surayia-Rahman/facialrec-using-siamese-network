This project implements facial verification using a Siamese network. A Siamese network is an artificial neural network that uses two or more identical subnetworks to process two or more inputs that share the same parameters and weights. The main application of this project is to verify if two given images are of the same person.

Facial verification is a technique used to determine if two images are of the same person. This project leverages a Siamese network, which is particularly effective for this task. The network learns to identify whether two input images belong to the same person or not.
